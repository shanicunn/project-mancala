### Mancala Proposal
## Project 1 for Per Scholas course


### Rules of the game
* 2 Players
* There are 48 marbles
* Game starts with 4 marbles in all 12 holes
* Player chooses a hole, picks up marbles, and dispenses marbles in other holes going towards their well
* If their last marble goes into the well they can choose a new hole to begin the process again
* If they end on an empty hole it is the opposing player's turn
* Repeat

### Technical Challenges
* Get marbles into holes (or use counter)
* For number in holes, disperse marbles (a nested loop?)
* Add marbles to new holes and well
* Count marbles in each hole
* Log current marbles in each hole
* End turn when an empty hole is reached
