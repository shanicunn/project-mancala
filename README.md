# project-mancala
Project 1 for Per Scholas course


### Rules of the game
2 Players
There are 48 marbles
Game starts with 4 marbles in all 12 holes
Player chooses a hole, picks up marbles, and dispenses marbles in other holes going towards their well
If their last marble goes into the well they can choose a new hole to begin the process again
If they end on an empty hole it is the opposing player's turn
Repeat

### Technical Challenges
Get marbles into holes (or use counter)
For number in holes, disperse marbles (a nested loop?)
Add marbles to new holes and well
While (player_1.holes.marbles > 0 || player_2.holes.marbles > 0) {
    play   
}
    if (player_1.holes.marbles <= 0) {
        Player 1 Wins
    } else {
        Player 2 Wins
    }
